Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into reusable, self-contained "objects." In Python, OOP is supported by a variety of features that allow you to create classes, which are blueprint-like structures for creating objects with specific attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). Here are the key concepts of OOP in Python:

CLASS:

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects will have.
It's like a template that describes the structure and behavior of objects.

OBJECT:

An object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete realization of the class blueprint.
Each object created from a class can have its own unique data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods).

ATTRIBUTES (Instance Variables):

Attributes are data members that store information about the object's state.
They are defined within the class and represent the characteristics of the objects.

CONSTRUCTOR (__init__ method):

The constructor method is called when an object is created from a class. It initializes the object's attributes.
It's typically used to set up the initial state of the object.

INHERITANCE:

Inheritance allows you to create a new class (subclass or derived class) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (base class or parent class).
The subclass can add or override attributes and methods as needed.

ENCAPSULATION:

Encapsulation refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class).
It helps to keep the internal details of the class hidden from the outside world, promoting data integrity and security.
